These scripts have been developed based off the work done by the [Institute of Climate and Atmospheric Science (ICAS)](http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/research/icas/) [dynamics](http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/research/icas/research-themes/atmosphere/) group and the University of Leeds. This work was originally part of the [African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis](https://www.amma2050.org/) (AMMA-2050) project.
